I'm a DevOps Engineer.

On a working day, I care about bringing the best experience to end users. Validating use cases, improving website speed but also pragmatically improve (technical) parts of the ecosystem.

## What else

In my spare time playing some board games, do some cooking (Curry, Rendang, Pasta, but mostly Italian and Thai kitchen), and sometimes some sports.

### Photography 📷

I take a lot of photos, during a walk or holidays. It's a challenge for me to go out, with minimal gear and deliver the most exciting composition and detail.
Some organisations requested me to take photo's at their event, <a href="https://ladolcevita-more.com/albums/" target="_blank">view photos</a>.

Some photos are available to buy:
