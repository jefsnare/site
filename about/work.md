My experience 10+ years of development experience in e-commerce, custom-built internal tools, and marketing platforms.
Overall perspective, modularization from the core, and a pragmatic approach are characteristics I've developed over time.
I'm always keen to learn something new, and I want to know every detail about it.

## Experience

In the past years, I've been architecting, building and maintaining medium to large scale web-apps and websites.

- Micro frontends and microservices
- (Headless) CMS solutions (Bloomreach Hippo CMS, Sitecore, Kentico, Magento)
- Performance testing and analyzing with Perfana, Grafana, Sitespeed, Rakyll Hey, and Node Clinic
- Building UI with React.js, Angular, Web Components, and Zurb Foundation
- Microsoft Azure, CI/CD Jenkins, and Github Actions, Kubernetes
- Decentralized and distributed systems
- High performant API's and Web frontends
